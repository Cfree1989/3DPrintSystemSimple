# 3D Print Lab Management System - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The goal is to build a 3D Print Lab Management System that transforms a manual, paper-based process into a streamlined, web-based workflow system. The system will serve both students and staff efficiently, providing a complete digital workflow from initial student submission through final pickup and payment.

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: The `solution_architecture.md` file is our immutable source of truth. All development must implement the comprehensive features and requirements outlined in that document. The architecture document NEVER changes - we only adapt our implementation approach to meet those requirements.

**Technical Approach**: We're using an ultra-minimal stack to keep the system simple, deployable, and maintainable:
- Multiple modular PHP files (5 files maximum)
- Frontend: Pure HTML/CSS/vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Backend: PHP with SQLite database
- Files: Local filesystem storage
- Email: PHP mail() function
- Target: Under 1000 lines of code total

This approach prioritizes simplicity and immediate deployment while delivering ALL the functionality outlined in the comprehensive solution architecture.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Constraints and Modularity Considerations
- **Modularity vs. Single File**: The original ultra-minimal stack calls for single file, but modularity improves maintainability
- **Revised Architecture Decision**: Adopting a "minimal file" approach instead of "single file" for better code organization
- **No Framework Dependencies**: Pure PHP/HTML/CSS/JS means building all functionality from scratch
- **SQLite Limitations**: Need to design a simple but effective database schema
- **File Management**: Local filesystem storage requires careful organization and security
- **Email Functionality**: Basic PHP mail() requires proper configuration

### Modularity Strategy
- **Core Application File**: Main index.php handles routing and includes other modules
- **Logical Separation**: Separate files for database operations, email functions, and utilities
- **Shared Components**: Common functions and classes in dedicated files
- **Maintainable Structure**: Clear separation of concerns while keeping total file count minimal

### Functional Priorities
- **Core Workflow**: Student submission â†’ Staff review â†’ Approval/Rejection â†’ Confirmation â†’ Status tracking
- **Essential Features**: File upload, cost calculation, email notifications, status management
- **User Experience**: Must remain professional and intuitive despite technical simplicity
- **Security**: Basic but adequate protection for student data and file uploads

### Design Decisions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic HTML forms, enhance with JavaScript
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works across devices
- **Clear Separation**: Logical organization of student vs. staff interfaces
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Rely only on standard PHP/HTML/CSS/JS capabilities

  - `index.php`: Main application with routing and HTML output
  - `database.php`: Database schema, connections, and data operations
  - `email.php`: Email templates and sending functions
  - `utils.php`: Common utility functions and validation
  - `config.php`: Configuration settings and constants
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic HTML forms, enhance with JavaScript
